# linked grid

The LinkedGrid class should offer a two-dimensional array to handle grid field reference ids. 
Additionally the class should contain a linked list for all grid fields to handle more data:
* Reference to pixi.js GFX element
* Column value
* Row value
* Color index value

The class needs a list with color values and a method to add color values.
