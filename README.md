# pixijsmix

This repository contains some pixi.js projects for your browser.
All projects use the 3.0.2 release of pixi.js and (optional) the 0.3.1 release of FPSMeter.

## Pixi.Metrix

The piximetrix folder contains the fifth edition of the metrix game.
The game has been written in C, Unit3D JS, smileBasic and AngularJS before.
The new version has a scaleable output to support mobile devices too.
